	a Love Story
</h1>

<pre>
Our story begins on one bright shiny day
in the university of kahiro, not very far away
on the first day of the RAMADAN fast
sat our hero Fred, practicing for a test
</pre>

<pre>
He sat and he thought about Sally, a friend
who is nice, and has a body you can't comprehend
But oh unlucky him, mama fate drew the line
Her father is a minister while his works in the mine
</pre>

<pre>
And as all of you listeners already know
different social-status-people can't even say hello!
</pre> 

<pre>
But our friend Fred did not at all yield
like a hero of love he took down his shield
and in every lecture of affairs of the state
he thought about ways to ask her out on a date
</pre>

<pre>
 <q>I'll give her some flowers and she'll be amazed</q>
he pondered and wondered and thought while he gazed
The results of his efforts to come were not late
for they went out that very night on a date 
</pre>

<pre>
They had a good time one can not deny
so the date went right by in the blink of an eye
On the next day, on their way to a class
they said a loud <q>Hi!</q> not just bypass
</pre>

<pre>
Beautiful Sally and diligent Fred
In order to not hear about them you'd have to be dead
In all of their lectures, they didn't look at their books
but were busy giving each other suggestive looks
</pre>

<pre>
Days and nights went by in a sweep
on which our Fred didn't manage to sleep
at last he said <q>She is the love of my life
I am going to ask her to be my wife!</q> 
</pre>

<pre>
On the very next day with a lousy fadora,
a ring and a ripped small container to store it'
<q>Join in to my life and it will improve!</q>
<q>I would love to, but firstly my dad must approve!</q>
</pre>

<pre>
The two went to her large estate land
where the father had waited, alchohol in his hand
<q>Sally!</q> shouted the dad with much joy
<q>You were'nt back i was worried, Who is this boy?</q>
</pre>

<pre>
<q>Daddy please welcome dear Fred, he's a friend
He came here to ask for my hand!!!!</q>
</pre>
